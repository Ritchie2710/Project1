      About Us Hi we are team CeeFilm our names are Rory, Edgar and Ritchie. We
      all come from different backgrounds but we all have a love of films and
      some times we struggle to choose a film. So we decided to design CeeFilm.

      CeeFilm is an app that allowes you to pick a film depending on your mood
      and genre. At the end of a number of questions a random choice of film
      will be picked from your the catalogue. This will then be shown in a graph
      so you can see what films have been choosen. the system has been set up so
      you can add more films from future releases to watch.
